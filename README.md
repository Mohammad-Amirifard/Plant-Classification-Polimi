# Guide on Plant Classification problem:
You should run notebooks, using google colab platforms. Since they have been written in this platforms.

1) Part1_Plant_Classification_EDA.ipynb includes EDA part on dataset. You can find dataset and other files in this link: <https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CzLGEZA7S0WhyVMTMUM-j4J6ptd6WyOx?usp=sharing>
2) Part2_Simple_Models_In_Plant_Classification.ipynb tries to use simple Convlutional neural networks on our problem
3) 3rd notebook tries to use more advanced CNNs on our problem, using transfer learning and fine tuning methods.
4)report.pdf file is a report of what we have done and it shws the progress of whole program.
