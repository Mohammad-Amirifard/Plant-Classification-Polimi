# Project Detail

**Problem**: Categorizing Healthy Plants Vs Unhealthy ones 

**Goal**: The task is to develop a model that is able to classify plants that are divided into two categories according to their state of health. It is a binary classification problem, so the goal is to predict the correct class label in {0, 1}.

# Dataset Detail:
**Image size:** 96x96
**Color space:** RGB
**File Format:** npz
**Number of classes:** 2
**Classes:**
0: "healthy"
1: "unhealthy"

# Dataset Structure:
containing the 'public_data.npz' file. The file contains the following items:
'data': numpy array of shape 5100x96x96x3, containing the RGB images.
'data': 3-dimensional numpy array of shape 5200x96x96x3, containing the RGB images.
'labels': 1-dimensional numpy array of shape 5200 with values in {'healthy', 'unhealthy'}
