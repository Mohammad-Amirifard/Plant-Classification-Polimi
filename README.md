# Guide on Plant Classification problem:
-->You should run notebooks, using google colab platforms. Since they have been written in this platforms.
-->1st notbook includes EDA part on dataset. You can find dataset and other files in this link: <https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CzLGEZA7S0WhyVMTMUM-j4J6ptd6WyOx?usp=sharing>
-->2nd notebook tries to use simple Convlutional neural networks on our problem.
--->3rd notebook tries to use more advanced CNNs on our problem, using transfer learning and fine tuning methods.
--->report.pdf file is a report of what we have done and it shws the progress of whole program.
